# Gentoonad-Pi
This repository is for the configuration files that are used to set up a Gentoo OS on a Raspberry Pi 4. This OS attempts to have the majority of the desktop environment to be written/compiled in Haskell.

The name Gentoonad comes from the combination of Gentoo and Monad.

Currently, I have the Pi configured to run as a headless system. The main to access the desktop environment would be to connect with a VNC client.

Notable Packages:
- Xmonad
- Termonad
- Taffybar
